				<p>There's a good reason: in a world where everything has its price, we want to know if our dreams of traveling the world can become a reality. Especially when our pockets tend to be empty more often than full of cash... it's easy to feel like we will never be able to afford to travel the world.</p>

				<p>The good news is that the world is always changing, and you no longer need to be wealthy to travel — you just need to know how to make the cash you do have work harder for you!</p> 

				<p>For example, by pinpointing the hidden travel costs you can avoid to save money, you'll quickly discover how easy it can be to travel on a budget. By the end of this article, you'll be perfectly prepared to plan a wonderful trip that won't cost you your entire life savings!</p>

				<p>These are my very own budget travel tips, gained over the past nine+ years that I've been traveling, and the nine countries I've visited — with family, friends, and on my own. Some of these might be considered "travel hacks to save money" — I like to call it "good planning!"(text by Worldpackers Website)</p>
